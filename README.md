In this project I look into why the TX Rangers have been struggling offensively this season, and give analysis and recommendationâ€™s for change. I look into the teams offensive philosophy and how they can adjust. As well as, individual players approaches and what they can change to revert back to their dominant selves. These include Marcus Semien, Joc Pederson, and Adolis Garcia.
